So you want to build a bundle?

{% block about_header_block %}

ELSA helps you to build PDS4 compliant labels for your data by building your bundle all at once and will provide a downloadable template package partially filled-out for you to work with your node representative. 
To begin, ELSA needs some basic information about your bundle. 
Please provide a title for your bundle and select the version of the PDS4 IM you want to use (new users should choose the top-most selection for version). 
NOTE: Once the bundle is named, you will be directed to a 'Bundle View' that will prompt you for various parts of the bundles including the ability to add collections. 
Some collections are required by the ATM node and will be automatically generated for your use. 
Namely you will be expected to provide documentation for your bundle - a document collection has been generated for that purpose. 
XML_Schema and Context collections will also be generated for you. 
These serve as system augmentations for the PDS and will be completely handled by ELSA.

A bundle is a logical construct that can be used to archive to archive digital data within PDS. 
Bundles have a hierarchical structure that allow it to contain digial products within collections. 
PDS uses bundles as a way to provide a simple package to organize related data products as a data set. 
Each bundle contains a document collection and data collections. 
Your bundle may also contain other collections if needed (e.g., geometry, browse, calibration, etc.). 
Context and xml_schema collections are system collections that will be added by the Atmospheres Node (ATM) after your bundle is complete.
